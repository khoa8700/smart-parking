# Smart Parking

The automatic parking system with license plate recognition technology is designed to efficiently manage vehicle parking in a hassle-free manner. The system can detect and capture license plate information, which is then stored in a database along with the entry and exit times of the vehicle. This helps to keep track of the parking duration and enables the system to charge the appropriate fees. The system not only saves time for drivers but also ensures a safe and secure parking environment.
